* Recursion is a method that calls itself.It helps us to break big problems into a small problems
* You need to have a base case, in other words a stopping condition
* Recursion reduces the need for complex loops and auxiliary DS.
* It can also lead to out of memory errors/stack overflow exceptions
* Can reduce time complexity easily with memoization
* Works really well with recursive structures like trees and graphs


1. What is the base case?
2.What is the smallest amount of work i can do in each iteration?
